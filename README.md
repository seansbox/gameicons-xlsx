# gameicons-xlsx

A keyword searchable Excel representation of the incredible game-icons library

## Description

This is a XLSX version of game-icons generated by converting the icon definitions from gameicons-font CSS/TTF file into a structured CSV format, then converting it into an XLSX table. Additionally, it fetches description and tag data using game-icons.net's search service and integrates it with the output table, using a local cache/store to prevent excessive requests.

You can build it, but I've also included the final output XLSX document here for convenience.

## Usage

- Download and install the game-icons.ttf font file.
- Download and open the game-icons.xlsx document and enjoy!
